# Chuseino-impact
I am working on a game that is being developed using Unreal 5.5.

Soo.. ummm the Project source Files are too large to upload
I can't put it in GitHubüòµ‚Äçüí´

This is a project for school during grade 12 computer programming. I was asked to create an inquiry project, so I decided to make an open-world-based game, almost like Genshin Impact

Though I was approaching the deadline, I didn't finish the project, so this is all I have for now.
